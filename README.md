# The illusion of Happiness
## A data science project that gives an alternative view on the idea of 'Happiness' that to me is often misunderstood

I once across a report called that had countries ranked by how 'Happy' were there people, and saw a few countries that were nowhere to be seen in the ranks where I would place them. I happened to read this report in detail and was surprised to see that most indicators that were in favour of the top ranking countries were purely economic factors.
To me money has always been a tool, a way to amplify your life - but happiness, in my opinion, is just a state of mind. Rather the goal should be to be peaceful.

I then aggregated data across various aspects of life, from government databases, such as physical health, mental health, divorce rates, etc. and the results were surprising.
All the top 5 ranked countries on 'this' Happiness Index report were among those with the highest suicide rates, highest mental health issues, low fertility rate, highest divorce rates recorded globally, and so on.

This is a project to just share meaningful insights, and does not intend to challenge anyone's beliefs - but rather make one think.... what is Happiness to you ?

Below are some results and visualisations that should make one think.
